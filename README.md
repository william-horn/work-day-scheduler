# Work Day Scheduler (Version 1.0.0)

## **About**

[View deployment here.]()

Work Day Scheduler is a webpage that lists every hour of the day (12am-11:59pm) as a new row. Inside of each row, you can write down some task that you wish to accomplish within that given hour. Here's an example:

<img src="./resources/assets/imgs/task-ready.png">


The current hour is depicted with the red background color, the upcoming hours are depicted in green, and previous hours are gray. 

Once the current hour has passed and it has become grayed-out, you can **no longer edit the text within that row.** It will remain there until the next day has begun, and then **all task information will be deleted.**

To **save** a task, simply click on the blue 'Save' button to the far right.
